# REST API TEMPLATE

Hello! This template is for making your own REST API using Python and Flask. This guide will show you how to use the template.

## Getting Started

Running the REST API Server is as simple as pressing Run at the top of your Replit Editor. Then you can copy the URL at the top of the WebView Tab in the Replit Editor and put it into your browser, and Voila! Ignore the 404 page that comes up. This is meant to happen as there is no page for the `/` route.

## Documentation

The Routes premade with the Template are listed under the `/docs` route.

## How To Change the API

You can easily change the REST API to meet your needs. If you want to add a new route, go to `main.py` in the root directory. Then copy and paste any route and adjust it to your liking. You must remember to change the function name after the `def` keyword. Don't forget to change the documentation!

## Editing the Documentation

The documentation can be edited by going to `templates/docs.html` and copying and pasting the line of code and changing it to your liking.

## Thank you for using my template!
